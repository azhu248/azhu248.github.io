        And when it does, I will love you in the darkness. -Romulus Au Raa

        Dear Angie,
      </p>
      <p>
        Words cannot do justice my feelings for you, but I will try anyways. Your eyes shine like the stars themselves, and your presence warms me like the sun. My life before I met you felt like a night without stars, and I am grateful for every moment we spend together.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a moment I'll never forget, when we were eating together at Mojo. You were refuting some argument I made in the Great Lobster Debate, but I was so entranced by you that I didn't even care. I was just happy to be there with you, in that moment, in that place. Your eyes sparkled with passion. That was the moment I fell for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thank God for bringing someone as perfect as you into my life every day. Even if I were to write a thousand letters, I would never figure out the proper configuration of words to express my love for you, but I hope you gleaned a small portion of it from this letter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: right;">
        Love,
        <br />
        Andy
